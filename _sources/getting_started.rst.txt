Getting started
===============

If you haven't done so already, read :doc:`prerequisites` and follow the
applicable steps.


Processing the first waveform
-----------------------------

If you are new to swath processing, it may be informative to follow the
tutorial on (processing and) viewing a single waveform. While this is
not the kind of data that you will need to analyze a glaciers evolution,
this is its foundation. Knowledge about the smallest parts of the data
can help you understand the larger picture.

Find the tutorial in ``scripts/tutorial__process_first_waveform.ipynb``.


Processing the first track
--------------------------

Similar to viewing a single waveform, you might wonder how swath data of
a single track look like. Again, a single track will not tell you much
about a glacier's evolution, but it may help to understand higher level
data.

``scripts/tutorial__process_first_track.ipynb`` will give you a hand
using cryoswath to process a single track and visualize the data.
