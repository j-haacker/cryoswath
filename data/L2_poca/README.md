# L2_poca/readme

Level 2 (L2) data means point elevation estimates here. This is the
designated place to store the points of closest approach (POCA). These
are expected to be biased with regards to swath elevation estimates and
should in most contexts be treated separately. The structure currently
is year/month, however for L2 data you may have reason to store the data
per region or glacier.
