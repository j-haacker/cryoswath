# DEM/readme

This directory is the designated place for your reference(/digital)
elevation models (=DEM; I sticke to DEM instead of REM as it is more
commonly used). Please store them as geo-referenced .tif-files or other
formats read by `rasterio.open()`.

At the [Polar Geospatial Center's data
page](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/) you can download ArcticDEM, REMA
(for Antarctica), and EarthDEM.
