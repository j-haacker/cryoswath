Processing the first waveform
-----------------------------

If you are new to swath processing, it may be informative to follow the
tutorial on (processing and) viewing a single waveform. While this is
not the kind of data that you will need to analyze a glaciers evolution,
this is its foundation. Knowledge about the smallest parts of the data
can help you understand the larger picture.

Find the tutorial in ``scripts/tutorial__process_first_waveform.ipynb``.
