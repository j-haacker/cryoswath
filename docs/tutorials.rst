Tutorials
=========

There is a small number of tutorials that will be extended if I find support.
Those are Jupyter notebooks located in ``scripts`` with names starting with "tutorial".

``scripts/tutorial.ipynb`` will contain a step-by-step guide to retrieve gridded glacier surface elevation trends from raw (L1b) data.

``scripts/tutorial__poca.ipynb`` shows how the points of closest approach (POCA), that have a special meaning, can be retrieved.
