# cryoswath

cryoswath is a python package containing processing pipelines, a tool
library, and some pre-assemble data to retrieve and study CryoSat-2 data

## state

Currently, it is in the pre-beta phase. main contains those parts that I
believe to work if used as intended and that have been tested to some
extent. devel contains parts that I used successfully - use at your own
risk.

Check the [preliminary tutorial](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/blob/main/scripts/tutorial.ipynb)
for some inspiration how to start off.

## 🚀 features

- find all CryoSat-2 tracks passing over your region of interest
- download L1b data from ESA
- retrieve swath elevation estimates
- aggregate point data to gridded data

## dependencies

cryoswath builds on a number of other packages. See
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## 🐛 known issues

### missing dependencies

- the reference elevation model is not provided
- the RGI data are not automatically downloaded

### limitations

- only working for the Arctic at the moment (hard coded CRS)

### other issues

- too many small glaciers can lead the kernel to crash while gis
  calculations (encountered for the Alps on a notebook)
- paths (partly) only for UNIX systems

## 🎯 what's coming

- pipeline building gridded change rates
