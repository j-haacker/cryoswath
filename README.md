# cryoswath

cryoswath is a python package containing processing pipelines, a tool
library, and some pre-assemble data to retrieve and study CryoSat-2 data

## üå± state

Currently, it is in the beta phase. `main` contains those parts that I
believe to work if used as intended and that tested to some
extent. Other branches are for development.

Check the [preliminary tutorial](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/blob/main/scripts/tutorial.ipynb)
for some inspiration how to start off.

## ‚ú® features

- find all CryoSat-2 tracks passing over your region of interest
- download L1b data from ESA
- retrieve swath elevation estimates
- aggregate point data to gridded data
- fill data gaps using tested methods
- calculate change rates

## üöÄ getting started

### üê≥ Docker

1. clone repo
2. `docker run -d -it -v $(pwd):/altimetry_project cryoswath/cryoswath:nightly`
3. connect with your favorite IDE or `docker exec -it <container hash> sh`

### üêç conda

1. clone repo
2. `conda create --name env_name --file <base dir>/docker/conda_requirements.txt`
3. `conda activate env_name`
4. `conda install patch`
5. `find -name variables.py -path */env_name/*/xarray/coding/* -exec patch {} <base dir>/docker/custom_xarray.patch \;`

(Steps 4+5 are necessary to change `*=` to `x=x*` in the xarray code.)

## üìñ documentation

The documentation of functions is easily accessible at
[j-haacker.github.io/cryoswath](https://j-haacker.github.io/cryoswath/).

## dependencies

cryoswath builds on a number of other packages. See
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/blob/main/requirements.txt).

### external dependencies

- the reference elevation model is not provided
- the RGI data are not automatically downloaded

## üêõ known issues

- ! compatibility issues with xarray >= v2024.3.0  
    -> downgrade to 2024.1.1  
    -> apply patch as described in getting started -> conda -> steps 4+5
- projected rgi basins sometimes "invalid"
    -> add `.make_valid()` if it is missing somewhere
- it has mostly been tested for the Arctic

  Further: see [open issues](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/issues).
